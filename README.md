# How to not code, well

A pragmatic philosophy and framework for software engineering in the post-LLM era.

## Purpose

This repository provides a **collection of documents designed to help technical organizations bootstrap themselves into pragmatic post-LLM software development workflows**. Rather than prescribing a single approach, it offers strategic guidance, implementation patterns, and decision frameworks that teams can adapt to their specific context.

## Overview

The framework is built on three mutually reinforcing pillars:

| Pillar | Core Question | Guiding Value |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **LLM-First Code Reviews** | Where should human attention focus? | Intentionality |
| **Human-Driven, LLM-Navigated Development** | How should humans and LLMs collaborate? | Rigor |
| **Radical Self-Improvement** | How do systems get better over time? | Care |

## Core Thesis

Software engineering practices must evolve to leverage LLM strengths (exhaustive attention, pattern consistency, tireless execution) while preserving human strengths (strategic judgment, creative problem-solving, interpersonal collaboration).

## Key Documents

- **[Pragmatic Guide](docs/Pragmatic-Guide-Software-Engineering-Post-LLM-World.md)** - Strategic umbrella connecting all three pillars
- **[Foundational Technical Requirements](docs/Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md)** - The six technical foundations for implementation
- **[LLM-First Code Reviews](docs/LLM-Assisted-Code-Review.md)** - Pillar 1: Intentionality in review
- **[Human-Driven Development](docs/Human-Driven-LLM-Navigated-Software-Development.md)** - Pillar 2: Rigor in collaboration
- **[Radical Self-Improvement](docs/Radical-Self-Improvement-for-LLMs.md)** - Pillar 3: Care in continuous improvement

## The Six Technical Foundations

1. **Multi-Agent Framework** - Infrastructure for coordinating specialized LLM agents
2. **Collaborative Planning Framework** - Structured human-LLM collaboration
3. **PR Reviewer System** - Automated review with specialized agents
4. **Codebase Analysis Engine** - Deep code understanding
5. **Index-Based Documentation Strategy** - Always-current documentation
6. **Continual Self-Reflection Framework** - Autonomous system improvement

## Philosophy

> Each pillar supports the weight of the whole idea.

The three pillars are mutually reinforcing:
- Reviews inform self-improvement
- Self-improvement enhances reviews
- The collaboration model governs both

## A Living Document

**This repository is a living document.** It is expected to change and adapt significantly over time as we learn, experiment, and refine our understanding of human-LLM collaboration.

**Nothing in this repository should be considered sacred.** The ideas, patterns, and recommendations here represent our current best thinking, not immutable truths. We encourage:

- **Challenging assumptions** - If something doesn't work for your context, question it
- **Proposing alternatives** - Better approaches are always welcome
- **Adapting freely** - Take what works, modify what doesn't, ignore what's irrelevant
- **Contributing back** - Share your learnings so others can benefit

The field of LLM-assisted software development is evolving rapidly. What works today may be obsolete tomorrow, and what seems impractical now may become essential. This framework will evolve alongside that reality.

## Status

**Active Development** - This framework is under active development and will continue to evolve.
