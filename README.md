# Collaborative Development Framework

A pragmatic philosophy and framework for software engineering in the post-LLM era.

## Overview

This repository contains strategic documentation for a new paradigm of human-LLM collaboration in software development. The framework is built on three mutually reinforcing pillars:

| Pillar | Core Question | Guiding Value |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **LLM-First Code Reviews** | Where should human attention focus? | Intentionality |
| **Human-Driven, LLM-Navigated Development** | How should humans and LLMs collaborate? | Rigor |
| **Radical Self-Improvement** | How do systems get better over time? | Care |

## Core Thesis

Software engineering practices must evolve to leverage LLM strengths (exhaustive attention, pattern consistency, tireless execution) while preserving human strengths (strategic judgment, creative problem-solving, interpersonal collaboration).

## Key Documents

- **[Pragmatic Guide](docs/Pragmatic-Guide-Software-Engineering-Post-LLM-World.md)** *(coming soon)* - Strategic umbrella connecting all three pillars
- **[Foundational Technical Requirements](docs/Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md)** *(coming soon)* - The six technical foundations for implementation
- **[LLM-First Code Reviews](docs/LLM-Assisted-Code-Review.md)** *(coming soon)* - Pillar 1: Intentionality in review
- **[Human-Driven Development](docs/Human-Driven-LLM-Navigated-Software-Development.md)** *(coming soon)* - Pillar 2: Rigor in collaboration
- **[Radical Self-Improvement](docs/Radical-Self-Improvement-for-LLMs.md)** *(coming soon)* - Pillar 3: Care in continuous improvement

## The Six Technical Foundations

1. **Multi-Agent Framework** - Infrastructure for coordinating specialized LLM agents
2. **Collaborative Planning Framework** - Structured human-LLM collaboration
3. **PR Reviewer System** - Automated review with specialized agents
4. **Codebase Analysis Engine** - Deep code understanding
5. **Index-Based Documentation Strategy** - Always-current documentation
6. **Continual Self-Reflection Framework** - Autonomous system improvement

## Philosophy

> Each pillar supports the weight of the whole idea.

The three pillars are mutually reinforcing:
- Reviews inform self-improvement
- Self-improvement enhances reviews
- The collaboration model governs both

## Status

**Draft** - This framework is under active development.
