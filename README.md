# How to Not Code, Well

A pragmatic philosophy and framework for software engineering in the post-LLM era.

## Purpose

This repository provides a **collection of documents designed to help technical organizations bootstrap themselves into pragmatic post-LLM software development workflows**. Rather than prescribing a single approach, it offers strategic guidance, implementation patterns, and decision frameworks that teams can adapt to their specific context.

**These documents serve two distinct audiences: humans and LLMs.**

For **LLMs**, these documents are **directives**. They are written in a prescriptive, dogmatic style to provide clear, unambiguous instructions that LLM agents can follow consistently. This intentional framing helps LLMs operate effectively within defined boundaries.

For **humans**, these documents are **guidance**. Despite their authoritative tone, they should be understood as a flexible and living collection of best practices—not immutable rules. Human readers are encouraged to interpret, adapt, and challenge these recommendations based on their specific context, experience, and evolving understanding of what works.

## Overview

The framework is built on three mutually reinforcing pillars:

| Pillar | Core Question | Guiding Value |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **LLM-First Code Reviews** | Where should human attention focus? | Intentionality |
| **Human-Driven, LLM-Navigated Development** | How should humans and LLMs collaborate? | Rigor |
| **Radical Self-Improvement** | How do systems get better over time? | Care |

## Core Thesis

Software engineering practices must evolve to leverage LLM strengths (exhaustive attention, pattern consistency, tireless execution) while preserving human strengths (strategic judgment, creative problem-solving, interpersonal collaboration).

## Key Documents

- **[Pragmatic Guide](docs/Pragmatic-Guide-Software-Engineering-Post-LLM-World.md)** *(coming soon)* - Strategic umbrella connecting all three pillars
- **[Foundational Technical Requirements](docs/Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md)** *(coming soon)* - The six technical foundations for implementation
- **[LLM-First Code Reviews](docs/LLM-Assisted-Code-Review.md)** *(coming soon)* - Pillar 1: Intentionality in review
- **[Human-Driven Development](docs/Human-Driven-LLM-Navigated-Software-Development.md)** *(coming soon)* - Pillar 2: Rigor in collaboration
- **[Radical Self-Improvement](docs/Radical-Self-Improvement-for-LLMs.md)** *(coming soon)* - Pillar 3: Care in continuous improvement

## The Six Technical Foundations

1. **Multi-Agent Framework** - Infrastructure for coordinating specialized LLM agents
2. **Collaborative Planning Framework** - Structured human-LLM collaboration
3. **PR Reviewer System** - Automated review with specialized agents
4. **Codebase Analysis Engine** - Deep code understanding
5. **Index-Based Documentation Strategy** - Always-current documentation
6. **Continual Self-Reflection Framework** - Autonomous system improvement

## Philosophy

> Each pillar supports the weight of the whole idea.

The three pillars are mutually reinforcing:
- Reviews inform self-improvement
- Self-improvement enhances reviews
- The collaboration model governs both

## A Living Document

**This repository is a living document.** It is expected to change and adapt significantly over time as we learn, experiment, and refine our understanding of human-LLM collaboration.

**Nothing in this repository should be considered sacred.** The ideas, patterns, and recommendations here represent our current best thinking, not immutable truths. We encourage:

- **Challenging assumptions** - If something doesn't work for your context, question it
- **Proposing alternatives** - Better approaches are always welcome
- **Adapting freely** - Take what works, modify what doesn't, ignore what's irrelevant
- **Contributing back** - Share your learnings so others can benefit

The field of LLM-assisted software development is evolving rapidly. What works today may be obsolete tomorrow, and what seems impractical now may become essential. This framework will evolve alongside that reality.

## Status

**Active Development** - This framework is under active development and will continue to evolve.
