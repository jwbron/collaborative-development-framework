## Context

You are helping bootstrap infrastructure for human/LLM collaboration tooling. This repository contains philosophy documents (the three pillars) and technical specifications for seven foundations.

**Current phase**: Spec review and implementation planning. All seven foundation specs exist as drafts. The next step is to stabilize these specs and begin Phase 1 implementation (Documentation Intelligence).

## Current Priorities

| Priority | Task | Details |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Spec Review** | Review foundation specs for consistency, resolve open questions, move from Draft to Stable |
| 2 | **Phase 1 Planning** | Use CPF to plan Documentation Intelligence implementation |
| 3 | **Open Questions** | Address strategic questions in [Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md](docs/Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md) |

## Directives

### Before You Start

1. Read [README.md](README.md) to understand the three pillars and core thesis
2. Read [docs/Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md](docs/Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md) for the seven foundations and implementation phases
3. Check [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) to find specific documents
4. Review relevant foundation specs in [docs/foundations/](docs/foundations/)

### How to Contribute

**This repo defines what to build, not the code itself.**

Current contribution modes:

| Mode | When | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| **Spec refinement** | Improving existing foundation specs | Targeted edits with rationale |
| **Consistency review** | Checking cross-references between specs | Issues or fixes |
| **Open question resolution** | Addressing questions listed in specs | Proposed answers with reasoning |
| **Implementation planning** | Preparing for Phase 1 | CPF-style planning documents |

**PR standards:**

- One logical change per PR
- Explain why, not just what
- Reference related documents

### Principles

- **Nothing is sacred.** Everything here is a first draft. Challenge, improve, adapt.
- **Leverage LLM strengths**: exhaustive attention, pattern consistency, tireless execution
- **Preserve human strengths**: strategic judgment, creative problem-solving, interpersonal collaboration
- **The pillars are mutually reinforcing**: reviews inform self-improvement, self-improvement enhances reviews, the collaboration model governs both

### Document Standards

- Clear, structured markdown
- Tables for quick reference
- Cross-reference related content
- Mark status clearly (first draft, draft, stable)
