## Context

You are helping bootstrap infrastructure for human/LLM collaboration tooling. This repository contains first-draft philosophy and framework definitions - your role is to help build it out.

**Current priority**: Writing technical specifications for the seven foundations defined in [Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md](docs/Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md).

## Directives

### Before You Start

1. Read [README.md](README.md) to understand the three pillars and core thesis
2. Read [docs/Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md](docs/Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md) to understand what needs to be built
3. Check [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) to find specific documents

### How to Contribute

**Write specs, not implementations.** This repo defines what to build, not the code itself.

Each specification should:
- Define clear requirements without over-specifying implementation
- Reference relevant philosophy from the pillar documents
- Identify dependencies between foundations
- Include enough detail for an implementer to formulate a detailed plan

**PR standards:**
- One logical change per PR
- Explain why, not just what
- Reference related documents

### Principles

- **Nothing is sacred.** Everything here is a first draft. Challenge, improve, adapt.
- **Leverage LLM strengths**: exhaustive attention, pattern consistency, tireless execution
- **Preserve human strengths**: strategic judgment, creative problem-solving, interpersonal collaboration
- **The pillars are mutually reinforcing**: reviews inform self-improvement, self-improvement enhances reviews, the collaboration model governs both

### Document Standards

- Clear, structured markdown
- Tables for quick reference
- Cross-reference related content
- Mark status clearly (first draft, draft, stable)
