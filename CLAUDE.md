# Collaborative Development Framework - LLM Instructions

## Quick Orientation

This repository contains a **strategic framework for post-LLM software development** - it's documentation and philosophy, not code. Your role is to help build out the tooling and infrastructure described here.

**What this repo IS:**
- A collection of guiding documents for human-LLM collaboration
- A philosophy for software engineering in the post-LLM era
- Specifications for six technical foundations to be built

**What this repo IS NOT:**
- A codebase to run or test
- A finished product - this is a living document under active development

## The Framework at a Glance

### Three Pillars

| Pillar | Focus | Value |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **LLM-First Code Reviews** | Where should human attention focus? | Intentionality |
| **Human-Driven, LLM-Navigated Development** | How should humans and LLMs collaborate? | Rigor |
| **Radical Self-Improvement** | How do systems get better over time? | Care |

### Six Technical Foundations

These are the infrastructure components to be built:

1. **Multi-Agent Framework** - Coordinate specialized LLM agents
2. **Collaborative Planning Framework** - Structure human-LLM collaboration
3. **PR Reviewer System** - Automated review with specialized agents
4. **Codebase Analysis Engine** - Deep code understanding
5. **Index-Based Documentation Strategy** - Always-current documentation
6. **Continual Self-Reflection Framework** - Autonomous system improvement

## How to Work in This Repo

### Reading and Understanding

1. **Start with README.md** - Understand the three pillars and core thesis
2. **Check docs/** - Read any available detailed documentation
3. **Note the "coming soon" markers** - These indicate content to be created

### Contributing Content

When adding or modifying documentation:

- **Maintain consistency** with the three-pillar structure
- **Use clear, structured markdown** with tables and hierarchical headings
- **Cross-reference related sections** to show how pillars reinforce each other
- **Mark status clearly** - indicate what's implemented vs. planned
- **Keep the living document philosophy** - nothing is sacred, improvements welcome

### Building the Technical Foundations

When implementing the six technical foundations:

1. **Consult the Foundational Technical Requirements doc** (when available) for specifications
2. **Create separate repos/modules** for each foundation as appropriate
3. **Link implementations back** to this framework document
4. **Update status** in README.md as foundations are built

## Key Principles to Uphold

From the framework's philosophy:

- **Leverage LLM strengths**: exhaustive attention, pattern consistency, tireless execution
- **Preserve human strengths**: strategic judgment, creative problem-solving, interpersonal collaboration
- **The pillars are mutually reinforcing**: reviews inform self-improvement, self-improvement enhances reviews, the collaboration model governs both

## Current Status

**Active Development** - The framework itself is evolving. When working here:

- Check README.md for current state
- Look for "coming soon" markers to identify needed content
- Propose improvements via PRs with clear rationale
- Challenge assumptions that don't fit your context

## For Autonomous Agents

If you're an autonomous agent working on this repo:

1. **Always read README.md first** to understand current scope
2. **Check for existing docs/** before creating new documents
3. **Maintain the established structure** (three pillars, six foundations)
4. **Update cross-references** when adding new content
5. **Keep PRs focused** - one logical change per PR
6. **Document your reasoning** in PR descriptions
