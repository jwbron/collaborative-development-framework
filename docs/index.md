# Documentation Index

> A navigation hub for efficiently locating relevant documentation within this framework.

## Quick Start

| Goal | Start Here |
|------|------------|
| Understand the framework | [README.md](../README.md) |
| Configure LLM agents | [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) |
| Find a specific document | [Document Catalog](#document-catalog) |
| Find by topic | [Topic Index](#topic-index) |
| Contribute content | [Contributing](#contributing) |

## Document Catalog

### Core Framework Documents

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [Pragmatic Guide](Pragmatic-Guide-Software-Engineering-Post-LLM-World.md) | Strategic umbrella connecting all three pillars | Planned |
| [Foundational Technical Requirements](Foundational-Technical-Requirements.md) | The six technical foundations for implementation | Planned |

### Pillar Documentation

| Pillar | Document | Focus | Status |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1. Intentionality | [LLM-First Code Reviews](LLM-Assisted-Code-Review.md) | Where human attention should focus | Planned |
| 2. Rigor | [Human-Driven Development](Human-Driven-LLM-Navigated-Software-Development.md) | How humans and LLMs collaborate | Planned |
| 3. Care | [Radical Self-Improvement](Radical-Self-Improvement-for-LLMs.md) | How systems get better over time | Planned |

### Configuration & Meta

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [README.md](../README.md) | Public overview, three pillars, six foundations |
| [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) | LLM agent orientation and working guidelines |
| [docs/index.md](index.md) | This navigation index |

## Topic Index

Find documentation by topic:

| Topic | Relevant Documents | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| **Agent coordination** | Foundational Technical Requirements | Multi-Agent Framework foundation |
| **Code review** | LLM-First Code Reviews | Pillar 1, PR Reviewer System foundation |
| **Collaboration patterns** | Human-Driven Development, Pragmatic Guide | Pillar 2, Collaborative Planning foundation |
| **Documentation strategy** | This index, CLAUDE.md | Index-Based Documentation foundation |
| **Self-improvement** | Radical Self-Improvement | Pillar 3, Continual Self-Reflection foundation |
| **Technical requirements** | Foundational Technical Requirements | All six foundations |

## For LLM Agents

### Navigation Strategy

When working in this repository:

1. **Check this index first** to locate relevant documentation
2. **Read linked documents** before starting implementation
3. **Note document status** - "Planned" documents don't exist yet
4. **Cross-reference pillars** - changes often affect multiple areas

### Document Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Available** | Document exists and is current |
| **Planned** | Document referenced but not yet created |
| **Draft** | Document exists but is incomplete |
| **Outdated** | Document exists but needs updates |

### Creating New Documents

When creating documents referenced in this index:

1. **Follow the established structure** - three pillars, six foundations
2. **Update this index** with correct status
3. **Add cross-references** to related documents
4. **Maintain dual-audience tone** - directive for LLMs, guidance for humans

## Contributing

### Adding New Documentation

1. Create the document in the appropriate location
2. Update this index with the new entry
3. Update [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) if it affects LLM workflows
4. Update [README.md](../README.md) if it's a major addition

### Updating the Index

This index should be updated when:

- New documents are added
- Document status changes
- Document locations change
- New topics emerge that warrant indexing

*This index is part of the living documentation system. Keep it current as the framework evolves.*
